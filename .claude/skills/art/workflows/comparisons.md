# Illustrated Dichotomies & Comparisons Prompt Workflow

**Generates prompts for hand-drawn side-by-side visual comparisons using UL aesthetic.**

Creates **VISUAL COMPARISON PROMPTS** — "X vs Y" split compositions, before/after transformations, and illustrated contrasts with editorial style.

**Output:** A structured prompt ready to paste into any AI image generator.

---

## Purpose

Illustrated comparisons show two contrasting concepts, states, or approaches side-by-side. These are **visual dichotomies** that make differences immediately obvious through illustrated metaphor.

**Use this workflow for:**
- "X vs Y" comparisons
- Before/After transformations
- This/That contrasts
- Junior vs Senior behaviors
- Old way vs New way
- Opposite approaches

## Visual Aesthetic: Split Screen Editorial

**Think:** Magazine spread showing contrast, split composition with personality

### Core Characteristics
1. **Split composition** — Clear left/right or top/bottom division
2. **Mirror structure** — Parallel visual elements showing contrast
3. **Hand-drawn** — Both sides maintain editorial imperfect linework
4. **Color differentiation** — Purple for one side, teal for other (or both black)
5. **Immediate contrast** — Differences obvious at a glance
6. **Editorial style** — Flat colors, black linework, UL aesthetic
7. **Balanced layout** — Equal visual weight to both sides

---

## Color System for Comparisons

### Split Differentiation
```
Left/Top Side: Purple #4A148C accents
Right/Bottom Side: Teal #00796B accents
OR
Both sides: Black with strategic purple/teal highlights
```

### Structure
```
Black #000000 — Dividing line, all linework on both sides
Charcoal #2D2D2D — All text and labels
```

### Background
```
White #FFFFFF or Light Cream #F5E6D3 on both sides
OR
Left: Light Purple tint, Right: Light Teal tint (very subtle)
```

### Color Strategy
- Option 1: Purple accents left, Teal accents right (clear differentiation)
- Option 2: Both black linework, purple on "preferred" side
- Dividing line always black
- Maintain flat aesthetic, no gradients

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define Comparison

**Identify what you're contrasting:**

1. **What are the two sides?**
   - Side A: [Concept / State / Approach]
   - Side B: [Concept / State / Approach]

2. **What's the key difference?**
   - [What fundamentally distinguishes them]

3. **What visual metaphors show the contrast?**
   - Side A metaphor: [Physical object/scene]
   - Side B metaphor: [Contrasting object/scene]

4. **Is one side "better" or are they equal alternatives?**
   - Better: [Which side to highlight in purple]
   - Equal: [Use balanced color or both in black]

**Output:**
```
COMPARISON: [Side A] vs [Side B]

CORE CONTRAST: [What's fundamentally different]

VISUAL METAPHORS:
- Side A: [Metaphor showing this approach/state]
- Side B: [Contrasting metaphor]

VALUE JUDGMENT:
- [Neutral comparison] OR [Side X is preferred]

COLOR STRATEGY:
- [Purple left / Teal right] OR [Purple on preferred, black on alternative]
```

### Step 2: Design Split Layout

**Plan the visual structure:**

1. **Split orientation:**
   - Vertical split (left/right) — Classic comparison
   - Horizontal split (top/bottom) — Before/after flow
   - Diagonal split — More dynamic

2. **Mirror elements:**
   - What visual elements repeat on both sides
   - How metaphors contrast (same structure, different details)
   - Balance of visual weight

3. **Dividing line:**
   - Strong black line separating sides
   - Soft visual separation
   - No line (color/metaphor creates division)

**Output:**
```
SPLIT ORIENTATION: [Vertical left/right / Horizontal top/bottom]

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
Left/Top: [Side A]
- Metaphor: [What to illustrate]
- Key elements: [Specific visual details]
- Color: [Purple accents / Black only]

Right/Bottom: [Side B]
- Metaphor: [Contrasting illustration]
- Key elements: [Specific visual details]
- Color: [Teal accents / Black only]

DIVIDING LINE:
- [Strong black vertical/horizontal line] OR [Soft separation] OR [No line]

MIRROR ELEMENTS:
- [What appears on both sides for parallel structure]
```

---

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Prompt Template

```
Hand-drawn split composition comparing two contrasting concepts in editorial style.

STYLE REFERENCE: Magazine comparison spread, split-screen editorial illustration, before/after visual

BACKGROUND: [White #FFFFFF OR Light Cream #F5E6D3] — clean, flat, both sides

AESTHETIC:
- Split composition with [vertical/horizontal] division
- Hand-drawn black linework on both sides (imperfect, gestural)
- Mirror structure showing parallel concepts with visual contrast
- Editorial flat color with strategic purple/teal differentiation
- Variable stroke weight, organic lines

SPLIT ORIENTATION: [Vertical left-to-right / Horizontal top-to-bottom]

COMPOSITION STRUCTURE:
- Clear [vertical/horizontal] division creating two equal sections
- [Black dividing line] OR [Visual separation through composition]
- Left/Top: [Side A name]
- Right/Bottom: [Side B name]

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM (3-TIER):

TIER 1 - COMPARISON TITLE (Advocate Block Display):
- "[SIDE A] VS [SIDE B]" — Large at top
- Font: Advocate style, extra bold, hand-lettered, all-caps
- Size: 3x larger than body text
- Color: Black #000000
- Position: Top center above split
- Example: "JUNIOR ENGINEER VS SENIOR ENGINEER"

TIER 2 - SIDE LABELS (Concourse Sans):
- Left/Top: "[Side A]"
- Right/Bottom: "[Side B]"
- Font: Concourse geometric sans-serif
- Size: Medium readable
- Color: Charcoal #2D2D2D
- Position: Headers for each side

TIER 3 - ANNOTATIONS (Advocate Condensed Italic):
- Key characteristics: "*overthinks*" vs "*simplifies*"
- Font: Advocate condensed italic
- Size: 60% of Tier 2
- Color: Matches side color (Purple left, Teal right)
- Position: Within each side's visual

LEFT/TOP SIDE - [SIDE A]:
Visual metaphor: [Describe the illustration, e.g.:]
- [Metaphor showing Side A characteristic]
- Hand-drawn with [imperfect lines, gestural quality]
- Color: Purple (#4A148C) accents on [specific elements]
- Black (#000000) primary linework
- Represents: [What this side embodies]

RIGHT/BOTTOM SIDE - [SIDE B]:
Visual metaphor: [Contrasting illustration, e.g.:]
- [Metaphor showing Side B characteristic]
- Hand-drawn matching style to left side
- Color: Teal (#00796B) accents on [specific elements]
- Black (#000000) primary linework
- Represents: [What this side embodies]

[OR if one side is preferred:]
- Preferred side: Purple (#4A148C) accents
- Alternative side: Black only (or subtle Teal)

DIVIDING LINE:
- [Strong black vertical/horizontal line down center] OR
- [Soft visual separation through composition and color]

COLOR USAGE:
- Black (#000000) for all linework on both sides and dividing line
- Left side: Purple (#4A148C) accents on [elements]
- Right side: Teal (#00796B) accents on [elements]
- Charcoal (#2D2D2D) for all label text
- OR: Purple on preferred side only, black on alternative

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Hand-drawn editorial style on BOTH sides (consistent aesthetic)
- Clear visual contrast between sides (metaphors show difference)
- Mirror structure (parallel elements contrasted)
- Strategic color differentiation (purple vs teal, or purple on better side)
- No gradients, flat colors only
- Immediate visual understanding of the difference
- Equal visual weight to both sides (balanced composition)

Sign "Kai" small in bottom right corner in charcoal (#2D2D2D).

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Split Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Vertical split (left/right) | 16:9 or 21:9 | Wide for side-by-side |
| Horizontal split (top/bottom) | 9:16 or 1:1 | Vertical or square for stacking |
| Square balanced | 1:1 | Symmetric comparison |
| Social media | 1:1 | Instagram/LinkedIn friendly |

**Default: 16:9 (horizontal)** — Classic side-by-side comparison

**Output:** Present the complete prompt to the user, ready for their image generator.

### Recommended Settings for Generation

When using the prompt, suggest these settings:
- **Aspect ratio:** As determined above (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, etc.)
- **Quality:** High/2K
- **Style:** If your tool has style options, choose "illustration" or "editorial"

---

## Example Use Cases

### Example 1: "Junior Engineer vs Senior Engineer"
- **Split:** Vertical left/right
- **Left (Junior):** Complex spaghetti code (purple tangle)
- **Right (Senior):** Simple elegant solution (teal straight line)
- **Color:** Purple left, Teal right
- **Aspect:** 16:9

### Example 2: "Before AI vs After AI"
- **Split:** Horizontal top/bottom
- **Top (Before):** Manual tedious work (person with paper pile)
- **Bottom (After):** Automated flow (person directing AI)
- **Color:** Purple on "After" (preferred state)
- **Aspect:** 9:16

### Example 3: "Security Theater vs Real Security"
- **Split:** Vertical left/right
- **Left (Theater):** Fancy locks on cardboard door
- **Right (Real):** Simple but solid construction
- **Color:** Purple right (effective), black left (ineffective)
- **Aspect:** 16:9

## Quick Reference

**Comparison Formula:**
```
1. Define comparison (sides, contrast, metaphors)
2. Design split layout (orientation, mirror elements, colors)
3. Construct prompt with split structure
4. Choose aspect ratio for split type
5. Output prompt to user
```

**Color Strategy:**
- Balanced comparison: Purple left, Teal right
- Value judgment: Purple on better side, black on other
- Neutral: Both black with subtle purple/teal accents

**Key Principle:**
- Difference should be immediately obvious
- Visual metaphors do the talking, minimal text needed
